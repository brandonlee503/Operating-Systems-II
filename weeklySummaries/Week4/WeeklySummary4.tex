\section{Rhetorical Precis}

Robert Love's sixth and seventh chapter of “Linux Kernel Development” (2010) explains the foundational concepts of kernel data structures as well as interrupts and handlers to the modern operating system.  Love supports his claims through explanations of various fundamental data structures from linked lists to rbtrees as well as interrupts through numerous interrupt model dichotomies.  Love's purpose is to illustrate these core components in the kernel in order to promote the usage of the various tools users have in disposal for themselves.  From the use of technical terminology, Love writes to an audience of knowledgeable readers who have a bit of knowledge in the kernel and lower level architecture.
